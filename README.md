# CuriculaFacultate
OOP - Curriculum for my Faculty where I can add the students, professors, classes and their type. We can also search by name and print the curriculum for any student.

I made this in Code::Blocks. To open it, simply download the files and execute curicula.cbp.

# What I Learned

* Using inherited classes and polymorfism.
* Modularization.
* Improved my ability to work with pointers.
